On January 19th, 2017 CUPFA signed a letter of agreement (LOA) concerning the posting of courses for the Summer Term. \xa0A similar LOA was signed in 2012, 2014 and 2015. \xa0This LOA will apply only to the current year. \xa0
\xbb Download LOA January 19 2017
The minor modifications of this new protocol were agreed to by CUPFA following discussions that would accommodate the Employer, while keeping the dates at the end of the process intact. \xa0The Employer\u2019s position was that the timing of the initiation of the hiring process was difficult to incorporate into their deadlines. \xa0This new process will now give the same amount of time as that allocated for the other hiring processes in the May and October periods.
The dates will be modified as follows:
Posting deadlines:\xa0

\xa0from February 1st to\xa0
February 10th
