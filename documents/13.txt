 or come by our office located at H-222
\n\n
The service is free for all Concordia undergraduate students.
\n\n
For Concordia graduate students, the first two pages (oath or true copy) is free of charge. After two pages, a fee of $1.00 per oath or true copy shall apply.
\n\n
For Concordia non-students, a fee of $5.00 per oath or true copy shall apply. In order to access this service, the Centre requires that you present yourself before the Commissioner for Oaths with a valid Concordia Student ID card and necessary photocopies if applicable. Non-students who wish to access the service must present themselves with a valid ID card with signature such a driver's license or Medicare card. If you require more than 15 true copies, the Centre requires that you make an appointment in advance in order to better accommodate you.
\n\n
Please note that the Centre reserves the right to refuse to administer any true copies and/or declarations. The Centre also reserves the right to cancel the service at any time based on office needs. If you cannot make the above-mentioned hours or require more information, please call (514) 848-7474 ext.7313 or email us at advocacy@csu.qc.ca .
\n\n
Did You Know?
\n\n
An oath or solemn declaration is when an individual swears and/or declares that the contents of a document are factual and accurate. The oath or declaration must be administered before an authorized person such as a Commissioner for Oaths in order to be considered valid.

FAQ regarding Student Advocates
\n\n
What does an Advocate do? \xa0
\n\n
Student Advocates are committed to the promotion and preservation of undergraduate students\u2019 rights and interests at Concordia University. Advocates work at assisting students with student requests, issues relating to professors and other students, promoting student's academic and extra-curricular interest on campus, working with members of the Concordia community on initiatives to advance those interests, issues relating to academic misconduct and violations of the Academic Code of Conduct, and issues relating to the Code of Rights and Responsibilities.
\n\n
Who are the Student Advocates?
\n\n
Student Advocates are Concordia Undergraduate students who have\xa0extensive knowledge of Concordia\u2019s policies and procedures, the Academic Code of Conduct, and the Code of Rights and Responsibilities. They aim to assist students whilst creating a safer space, and maintaining the utmost confidentiality.
\n\n
I just got a package in the mail saying that I\u2019ve been charged under the Academic Code of Conduct and that I have to go to an interview, what does this mean, can you help? 
\n\n
This package is known as a \u201cdiscovery package\u201d, and should contain a description of the charges against you, as well the date for an interview with the Code Administrator of your faculty. It is best to make an appointment with an advocate in order to discuss the situation. We can absolutely help you, answer any questions you may have and even accompany you to the interview.
\n\n
What is the Academic Code of Conduct?
\n\n
The Code of Conduct (Academic) is a University policy that outlines the procedures by which academic honesty or integrity is enforced. It outlines procedures for dealing with offenses and possible sanctions if charges are upheld.
\n\n
What is plagiarism?
\n\n
According to the Concordia Academic Code of Conduct plagiarism can be defined as follows: the presentation of the work of another person, in whatever form, as one\u2019s own or without proper acknowledgement.
