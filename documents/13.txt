FAQ regarding Student Advocates
\n
What does an Advocate do? \xa0
\n
Student Advocates are committed to the promotion and preservation of undergraduate students\u2019 rights and interests at Concordia University. Advocates work at assisting students with student requests, issues relating to professors and other students, promoting student's academic and extra-curricular interest on campus, working with members of the Concordia community on initiatives to advance those interests, issues relating to academic misconduct and violations of the Academic Code of Conduct, and issues relating to the Code of Rights and Responsibilities.
\n
Who are the Student Advocates?
\n
Student Advocates are Concordia Undergraduate students who have\xa0extensive knowledge of Concordia\u2019s policies and procedures, the Academic Code of Conduct, and the Code of Rights and Responsibilities. They aim to assist students whilst creating a safer space, and maintaining the utmost confidentiality.
\n
I just got a package in the mail saying that I\u2019ve been charged under the Academic Code of Conduct and that I have to go to an interview, what does this mean, can you help? 
\n
This package is known as a \u201cdiscovery package\u201d, and should contain a description of the charges against you, as well the date for an interview with the Code Administrator of your faculty. It is best to make an appointment with an advocate in order to discuss the situation. We can absolutely help you, answer any questions you may have and even accompany you to the interview.
\n
What is the Academic Code of Conduct?
\n
The Code of Conduct (Academic) is a University policy that outlines the procedures by which academic honesty or integrity is enforced. It outlines procedures for dealing with offenses and possible sanctions if charges are upheld.
\n
What is plagiarism?
\n
According to the Concordia Academic Code of Conduct plagiarism can be defined as follows: the presentation of the work of another person, in whatever form, as one\u2019s own or without proper acknowledgement.
\n
It is important to know that the Academic Code of Conduct does not consider the intent of the individual who committed the offence when applying a sanction. For example, you may be charged with plagiarism if you have an improperly cited bibliography. Please see the Academic Code of Conduct for more details.
