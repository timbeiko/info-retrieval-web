ABOUT
\n\n  
\n    
Art Matters is a non-profit festival that celebrates and supports the developing talent housed at\nConcordia University, with the aim of providing emerging artists with practical skills, tools, and\nknowledge.
\n\n    
Art Matters takes place in March. Exhibitions curated by students are spread out over three\nweeks, punctuated by our signature parties and events.
\n\n    
Art Matters is a fee-levy organization. That means a fraction of all students' tuition allows the\nfestival to take place. Art Matters is created by and for undergraduate Concordia University\nstudents.
\n\n    
Art Matters gets people together. We encourage students from different artistic practices to\nexchange ideas.
\n\n    
Art Matters supports new ideas. We promote diverse artistic approaches, processes, and\nrisk-taking.
\n\n    
Art Matters starts a dialogue between students and professionals. We provide galleries and\nvenues as platforms to promote artwork, as well as hosting speakers and workshops.
\n\n    
Art Matters strives to build an inclusive community. Art Matters encourages accessibility and\ndiversity.
\n\n    
Art Matters makes it known that Art Matters!
