Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 At the start of my teaching career, when I was fresh out of graduate school, I briefly considered trying to pass myself off as a cool professor. Luckily, I soon came to my senses and embraced my true identity as a young fogey.
After one too many students called me by my first name and sent me email that resembled a drunken late-night Facebook post, I took a very fogeyish step. I began 
attaching a page
 on etiquette to every syllabus: basic rules for how to address teachers and write polite, grammatically correct emails.
Over the past decade or two, college students have become far more casual in their interactions with faculty members. My colleagues around the country grumble about students\u2019 sloppy emails and blithe informality.
Mark Tomforde, a math professor at the University of Houston who has been teaching for almost two decades, added etiquette 
guidelines
 to his website. \u201cWhen students started calling me by my first name, I felt that was too far, and I\u2019ve got to say something,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere were also the emails written like text messages. Worse than the text abbreviations was the level of informality, with no address or signoff.\u201d

His webpage covers matters ranging from appropriate email addresses (if you\u2019re still using \u201ccutie_pie_98@hotmail.com,\u201d then \u201cit\u2019s time to retire that address\u201d) to how to be gracious when making a request (\u201cdo not make demands\u201d).

Sociologists who 
surveyed
 undergraduate syllabuses from 2004 and 2010 found that in 2004, 14 percent addressed issues related to classroom etiquette; six years later, that number had more than doubled, to 33 percent. This phenomenon crosses socio-economic lines. My colleagues at Stanford gripe as much as the ones who teach at state schools, and students from more privileged backgrounds are often the worst offenders.
Why are so many teachers bent out of shape because a student fails to call them \u201cProfessor\u201d or neglects to proofread an email? Are academics really that insecure? Is this just another case of scapegoating millennials for changes in the broader culture?
Don\u2019t dismiss these calls for old-fashioned courtesy as a case of fragile ivory tower egos or misplaced nostalgia. There is a strong liberal case for using formal manners and titles to ensure respect for all university professionals, regardless of age, race or gender. More important, doing so helps defend the university\u2019s dearest values at a time when they are under continual assault.
It\u2019s true that the conventions that have, until recently, ruled higher education did not rule from time immemorial. Two centuries ago, students often rejected expectations of deference. In 1834, Harvard students rebelled when some of their classmates were punished for refusing to memorize their Latin textbook. They 
broke
 the windows of a teacher\u2019s apartment and destroyed his furniture. When the president of the college cracked down and suspended the entire sophomore class, the juniors retaliated by hanging and burning him in effigy and setting off a rudimentary explosive in the campus chapel.
Later in the 19th century, etiquette manuals proliferated in bookstores, and Americans began to emphasize elaborate social protocols. As colleges expanded and academic disciplines professionalized, they mimicked the hierarchical cultures of the German research universities, where students cowered before \u201cHerr Professor Doktor.\u201d
The historian John Kasson has noted that back then, formal etiquette was not aimed at ensuring respect for all. It was, in part, a system to enforce boundaries of race, class and gender at a time when the growth of cities and mass transit forced Americans into close quarters with strangers. Codes of behavior served \u201cas checks against a fully democratic order and in support of special interests, institutions of privilege and structures of domination,\u201d he 
writes
 in his book \u201cRudeness and Civility
.

But today, on the other side of the civil rights revolution, formal titles and etiquette can be tools to protect disempowered minorities and ensure that the modern university belongs to all of us. Students seem more inclined to use casual forms of address with professors who are young, nonwhite and female \u2014 some of whom have responded by becoming vocal defenders of old-fashioned propriety.

Angela Jackson-Brown, a professor of English at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., told me that \u201cmost of my students will acknowledge that I\u2019m the first and only black teacher they\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Insisting on her formal title is important, she said: \u201cI feel the extra burden of having to go in from Day 1 and establish that I belong here.\u201d
When Professor Jackson-Brown began teaching in the 1990s, most students respected her authority. But in recent years, that deference has waned (she blames the informality of social media). \u201cI go out of my way now to not give them access to my first name,\u201d she said. \u201cOn every syllabus, it states clearly: \u2018Please address me as Professor Jackson-Brown.\u2019 \u201d
She linked this policy to the atmosphere of mutual respect that she cultivates in her classes. These days, simply being considerate can feel like a political act. \u201cAfter this recent election, I\u2019ve had several female students come to me and say, \u2018I\u2019m noticing differences in how men are treating me.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set standards for them that they may not see outside the classroom, places where you\u2019d think there would be decorum.\u201d
This logic resonates with some students. \u201cHaving these titles forces everyone to give that respect,\u201d Lyndah Lovell, a graduating senior at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., said. \u201cThey know they have to use these manners with everyone. Even if the underlying thoughts of prejudice will still be there to some extent, you give these thoughts less power.\u201d
Insisting on traditional etiquette is also simply good pedagogy. It\u2019s a teacher\u2019s job to correct sloppy prose, whether in an essay or an email. And I suspect that most of the time, students who call faculty members by their first names and send slangy messages are not seeking a more casual rapport. They just don\u2019t know they should do otherwise \u2014 no one has bothered to explain it to them. Explaining the rules of professional interaction is not an act of condescension; it\u2019s the first step in treating students like adults.

That said, the teacher-student relationship depends on a special kind of inequality. \u201cOnce I refer to them as I would my best friend, I eliminate that boundary of clarity,\u201d Ms. Lovell told me. She recalled how awkward she felt when the head of the research lab where she worked asked undergraduates to call him Willy. \u201cAll my friends were saying: \u2018Oh, man, do we do this? He has a Ph.D. He\u2019s a professor. Is it O.K. to do this?\u2019 Sometimes I do, but he\u2019s a great mentor, and it\u2019s confusing. A lot of us like to preserve that distance.\u201d
Alexis Delgado, a sophomore at the University of Rochester, is skeptical of professors who make a point of insisting on their title. \u201cI always think it\u2019s a power move,\u201d she told me. \u201cJust because someone gave you a piece of paper that says you\u2019re smart doesn\u2019t mean you can communicate those ideas to me. I reserve the right to judge if you\u2019re a good professor.\u201d
But she ruefully recalled one young professor who made the mistake of telling the class that he didn\u2019t care if they used his first name. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize how far it would go, and we all thought, this is awkward,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no desire to be friends. I only wanted to ask questions.\u201d
During office hours, we have frank conversations about career choices, mental health crises and family tribulations. But the last thing most students want from a mentor is the pretense of chumminess.

Ms. Lovell said the very act of communicating more formally helps her get some distance on a personal problem. \u201cWhen I explain my difficulties and struggles, I try to explain in a mature way,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know: How would someone older than me think through this?\u201d
The facile egalitarianism of the first-name basis can impede good teaching and mentoring, but it also presents a more insidious threat. It undermines the message that academic titles are meant to convey: esteem for learning. The central endeavor of higher education is not the pursuit of money or fame but knowledge. \u201cThere needs to be some understanding that degrees mean something,\u201d Professor Jackson-Brown said. \u201cOtherwise, why are we encouraging them to get an education?\u201d
The values of higher education are not the values of the commercial, capitalist paradigm. At a time when corporate executives populate university boards and politicians demand proof of a diploma\u2019s immediate cash value, this distinction needs vigilant defense.
The erosion of etiquette encourages students to view faculty members as a bunch of overeducated customer service agents. \u201cMore and more, students view the process of going to college as a business transaction,\u201d Dr. Tomforde, the math professor, told me. \u201cThey see themselves as a customer, and they view knowledge as a physical thing where they pay money and I hand them the knowledge \u2014 so if they don\u2019t do well on a test, they think I haven\u2019t kept up my side of the business agreement.\u201d He added, \u201cThey view professors in a way similar to the person behind the counter getting their coffee.\u201d
But if American culture in general \u2014 including many workplaces \u2014 has become less formal, are professors doing students a disservice by insisting on old-fashioned manners?
When Anna Lewis left a Ph.D. program in English to work at a technology firm, she had to learn to operate in a different culture. Yet she has noticed that the informality of the tech industry can mislead new millennial employees.
\u201cThey see they can call everyone from the C.E.O. down by their first name, and that can be confusing \u2014 because what they often don\u2019t realize is that there\u2019s still a high standard of professionalism,\u201d she told me. \u201cAt the intern level, these things are basic, but they require reminders: show up to meetings on time; be aware that you, yourself, are fully responsible for your work schedule. No one is going to tell you to attend a meeting.\u201d In other words, young graduates mistake informality for license to act unprofessionally.
\u201cThere is some value in being schooled in more formal etiquette, developing personal and professional accountability, a work ethic and a level of empathy, which is very much valued in the tech industry,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.

Here\u2019s an analogy: We should teach students traditional etiquette for the same reason most great abstract painters first mastered figurative painting. In order to abandon or riff on a form, you have to get the hang of its underlying principles.
\n
\n
That means that professors should take the time to explain these principles, making it clear that learning how to write a professional email and relate to authority figures is not just preparation for a job after graduation. The real point is to stand up for the values that have made our universities the guardians of civilization.
And if you\u2019re going to write an angry email telling me how wrong I am, I beg you: Please proofread it before you hit \u201csend.\u201d
