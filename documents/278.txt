PREAMBLE
\n\t\t\t\t\t
1.01\xa0 The parties recognize that the goals of the University are to attain the highest possible standards of academic excellence in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge, to be achieved principally through teaching, research and community service, and to maintain a strong tradition of both full-time and part-time higher education and to preserve a high standard of education. All other functions at Concordia University exist to support this central academic purpose.
\n
The parties agree to cooperate in the promotion of teaching and research and to encourage a climate of freedom of speech and enquiry, responsibility and mutual respect in the pursuit of these goals. A university environment characterized by freedom of speech and enquiry is required for the faculty members and librarians to fulfill their responsibilities. Freedom of speech guarantees the open exchange of ideas; freedom of enquiry guarantees the open investigation and interpretation of ideas.
\n
Within the unique university context, the most crucial right is academic freedom. We affirm that this right is meaningless unless it entails the right to raise probing questions and challenges to the beliefs of society at large.
\n
Academic freedom also implies that the parties agree to respect the right of all members of the academic community to exercise their academic freedom.
\n
1.02\xa0 It is the purpose of this Collective Agreement to foster and maintain harmonious relations within the university community and to provide an amicable and effective means for settling differences which may arise from time to time between the Employer and members of the bargaining unit.

ACADEMIC FREEDOM
\n\t\t\t\t\t
6.01\xa0 The purpose of academic freedom is to provide security for fundamental academic values.
\n
A university environment characterized by freedom of speech and of enquiry is required by the members to carry out the University\u2019s purpose.\xa0 Freedom of speech guarantees the University as an open forum for the exchange of ideas; freedom of enquiry guarantees the University\u2019s commitment to the open investigation and interpretation of ideas.
\n
Within the unique university context, the most crucial of human rights is the right to academic freedom. We affirm that this right is meaningless unless it entails the right to raise probing questions and challenges to the beliefs of society at large.
\n
The parties agree to respect the right of all members of the academic community to exercise their academic freedom.
\n
The commitments, rights, and responsibilities of members involve three major related roles:
\xa0
to participate in the search for basic truths, and to communicate openly the results of this search; to develop creative scholarship in specific disciplines, within which the students participate in the process of rational enquiry; to encourage where feasible the generalized application of scholarship and research to the benefit of the university community and the common good of society.
\n
Members are entitled to freedom, without any form of institutional censorship, to disseminate their knowledge both inside and outside the classroom, to conduct research which they believe will enhance knowledge and to communicate the results of such research.

12.01\xa0\xa0 
GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING APPOINTMENTS
\n
a)\xa0 The principal criteria for appointments are academic and professional excellence.
\n
b)\xa0 Canadian applicants for a faculty position shall be given first consideration and, in the case of candidates assessed as essentially equal, shall be given priority.
\n
c)\xa0 The Parties agree that Concordia University would better advance the essential functions of the University, namely the pursuit, creation and dissemination of knowledge through teaching and research, if the diverse composition of Canadian society were better reflected in the bargaining unit. Therefore the Parties agree to encourage an increase in the proportion of members of under-represented designated groups as defined in the relevant legislation, to improve their employment status, and to ensure their full participation in the University community. The Parties therefore endorse the principle of equity in employment and agree to cooperate in the identification and removal of all barriers to the recruitment, selection, hiring, retention, and promotion of these designated groups, and other categories as may be designated in federal and provincial human rights legislation or agreed to by the Parties.
\n
d)\xa0 The Employer shall provide a process through which members may voluntarily identify themselves as belonging to one or more designated groups. Information pertaining to members submitted to government agencies under relevant legislation on employment equity shall be made available to JEEC and to the Association on an aggregate basis within thirty (30) days of submission.
\n
e)\xa0 If the data on academic availability indicate that a designated group is under-represented in a given disciplinary sector in the University, then, all things being equal, candidates from that designated group shall be given priority in that disciplinary sector.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FACULTY MEMBERS
\n\t\t\t\t\t
16.01\xa0\xa0 The duties and responsibilities of faculty members fall into three (3) categories, regardless of
\n
where they are performed.
\n
\xa0
\n
a)\xa0 Teaching, which in general includes: the preparation, organization and presentation of course materials for credit courses and availability to students outside of class hours; curriculum development and preparation of course material for student use; the direction and evaluation of student progress in courses and practical work (including marking and timely submission of grades) and if so specified by the Dean, thesis and other student research supervision (see Article 14.01 a)).

The primary objectives of such research shall be to increase knowledge and understanding and to further the faculty member\u2019s teaching and scholarly competence.
\n
c)\xa0 Service to the University and the Community, which in general includes:
\n
i)\xa0 participation on University-wide bodies;
\n
\xa0
\n

\n
\xa0
\n
16.02\xa0 While the pattern of duties and responsibilities indicated in 16.01 varies among academic units and among individuals, these constitute the principal obligations of any faculty member holding a full\u2011time appointment.
\n
16.03\xa0\xa0 In accordance with the established procedures of the academic unit, and by mutual agreement with the faculty member, the academic unit heads and the Dean(s), academic duties may be assigned and carried out in academic units other than the member\u2019s primary unit. In the case of members holding a joint or cross appointment, or participating in an interdisciplinary teaching or research project with one or more members of another academic unit, academic duties in both primary and secondary units shall be considered part of the member\u2019s duties for the purposes of all evaluations conducted under the provisions of Articles 14 and 18.
\n
16.04\xa0\xa0 TEACHING LOAD AND TEACHING ASSIGNMENT
\n
a)\xa0 The teaching load for each member shall be determined in a fair and equitable manner by the Dean, who shall take into consideration the dossier submitted for the biennial performance evaluation, if applicable.
\n
b)\xa0 In years in which no performance review takes place, the Dean may request from some or all members of the Faculty a summary of teaching, research and service activities since the most recent performance review. Having assessed this material, the Dean may alter the teaching load in conformity with the provisions of Article 16.
\n
c)\xa0 A Faculty or academic unit may develop guidelines on course remissions to be used in the determination of teaching load. These guidelines shall require the approval of the Dean and may encompass such matters as supervision of undergraduate and graduate students, research, publications, other creative work, laboratory development, management and administrative duties, and other service responsibilities.
\n
d)\xa0 The annual teaching assignment for each member shall be fair and equitable, taking into account the nature of the courses (e.g. course levels, class sizes), number of different course preparations, and the member\u2019s research profile and service responsibilities.
\n
e)\xa0 By April 1 the academic unit head shall make available in writing to each member of the academic unit information concerning the teaching assignments of all full\u2011time faculty members of the academic unit for the current academic year.

A copy shall be sent to the Association, and the information for each academic unit shall be made available in writing to each member of the academic unit.
\n
h)\xa0 Any subsequent change to the teaching assignment shall require the faculty member\u2019s consent. Such consent in no way constitutes a precedent and shall not be unreasonably withheld.
\n
i)\xa0 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 16.04 h), if unforeseen teaching needs require it, the Dean may readjust the teaching assignment after consultation with the member. In doing so, the Dean shall take into account the impact of this readjustment on the other activities the faculty member intended to take on. The Dean shall give reasonable notice in writing to a faculty member whose teaching assignment is to be modified from the one established in Article 16.03 a) above. Courses added to the teaching assignment shall include only those that the member has taught in one or more of the previous three (3) academic years.
\n
j)\xa0 When the teaching program of an academic unit or a Faculty includes courses in each of the three (3) terms of the academic year, the faculty member\u2019s teaching assignment is spread out over the fall and winter terms, unless there is a written agreement with the faculty member to the contrary. In the case of those academic units that offer programs in the Institute for Cooperative Education, a faculty member\u2019s teaching assignment may be spread over any two (2) of three (3) terms, if the faculty member is participating in the programs, unless there is written agreement with the faculty member to the contrary.
\n
k)\xa0 Notwithstanding the above, and in the case of other special or extensive summer programs, a faculty member may, by mutual agreement, spread the teaching assignment over two (2) or three (3) terms, but no faculty member shall be required to teach during all three (3) terms except as specified in Article 16.12.
\n
l)\xa0 Provision may be made for the averaging of the teaching load over a two (2) year period. Other duties and responsibilities will be adjusted to reflect the averaging of teaching duties.

\n
any special conditions of appointment, and other activities.

\n
\xa0
\n
16.07\xa0\xa0 PROBATIONARY MEMBERS

\n
appointment to enable the member to establish a research program and to prepare new
\n
courses.
\n
\xa0
\n
16.08\xa0\xa0 TENURED MEMBERS
\n
a)\xa0 A teaching load not exceeding four (4) courses per academic year shall be assigned to a tenured faculty member where there is clear evidence of satisfactory productivity in research and scholarship during the most recent evaluation period, taking into account the extent of the member\u2019s service.
\n
b)\xa0 A teaching load not exceeding five (5) courses per academic year shall be assigned to a tenured faculty member where there is evidence of minimal productivity in research and scholarship during the most recent evaluation period, taking into account the extent of the member\u2019s service.
\n
c)\xa0 A teaching load not exceeding six (6) courses per academic year shall be assigned to a tenured faculty member where there is no clear evidence of productivity in research and scholarship during the most recent evaluation period, taking into account the extent of the member\u2019s service.
\n
d)\xa0 In setting the teaching load, the Dean may:
\n
i)\xa0 increase the member\u2019s teaching load if justified under the provisions of Article 16.08 a), b) and c), taking into account the extent of the member\u2019s service;
\n
\xa0
\n
ii)\xa0 reduce the member\u2019s teaching load if justified under the provisions of Article 16.08 a), b) and c) in cases where the member combines the teaching assignment with assigned extensive administrative responsibilities (e.g., undergraduate or graduate program Director), or with heavy responsibilities to manage and administer her or his research project(s).
\n
\xa0
\n
e)\xa0 No tenured member shall be assigned more than twelve (12) courses over a two (2) year period, except as specified in Article 16.12 a) or, by mutual agreement, as per Article 16.04 i), provided the overload is offset by an equivalent reduction in the academic year immediately preceding or following the two year period.

a)\xa0 The duties and responsibilities of ETA members shall be those specified in Article 16.01 a) and 16.01 c).
\n
b)\xa0 A teaching load not to exceed seven (7) courses per academic year shall be assigned to ETA members whose duties and responsibilities include normal service to the University. The Dean shall reduce the member\u2019s teaching load if the member combines the teaching assignment with more extensive service. In considering a member\u2019s service contribution, the Dean shall take into account not only specifically assigned administrative duties, such as program directorships, but also such activities as course coordination, committee work, coaching of students for academic competitions and recruitment activities.
\n
c)\xa0 The minimum teaching load for ETA members will normally be four (4) courses per academic year.
\n
d)\xa0 ETA members who, during an academic year, are assigned to teach five or more courses, each of which requires a distinct course preparation, shall receive a stipend of $1,500 for each of the fifth (5
th
), sixth (6
th
), or seventh (7
th
) distinct course preparation.
\n
16.10\xa0\xa0 LTA MEMBERS
\n
a)\xa0 The parties consider that a teaching load of seven (7) courses in a given academic year is appropriate for a member holding a twelve (12) month LTA appointment whose duties and responsibilities include minimal service to the University. However, for a member holding a nine and a half (9.5) month LTA, a teaching load of six (6) courses is appropriate for the period of appointment.
\n
b)\xa0 At least one (1) of the courses may be assigned in the summer term provided that twenty-two (22) consecutive days are available for vacation as per Article 31.06.
\n
c)\xa0 Members holding LTA appointments of twelve months or more, shall not teach more than fourteen (14) courses over a two (2) year period except as provided in Article 16.12 a).
\n
d)\xa0 Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of distinct course preparations in an academic year. LTA members who, during an academic year, are assigned to teach five or more courses, each of which requires a distinct course preparation, shall receive a stipend of $1,500 for each of the fifth (5
th
), sixth (6
th
), or seventh (7
th
) distinct course preparation.
\n
16.11\xa0\xa0 Members on leave should be consulted and shall be informed about their course assignments
\n
for the following academic year at the same time as other faculty members.

\n
b)\xa0 Members who wish to teach additional courses shall make their request in writing to the academic unit head or the Program Director as appropriate, who shall forward the request to the Dean and the Association with a recommendation.

\n
16.14\xa0\xa0 COURSE REMISSIONS AND BANKING OF CREDITS
\n
Course remissions will normally be used within the period for which they are allocated. In cases where the annual workload assigned by the Dean is not correspondingly reduced, the credits shall be banked.

In such event, except as provided for in Article 27.22, the Employer shall make no further use of the confidential information relating to the Invention. Any Net Proceeds shall be divided as set out in Article 27.18 (b).

\xa0
\n
a)\xa0 She or he shall so notify the Employer within twenty two (22) days of the determination that it is a Qualifying Invention, with a copy to the Association.
\n

\n
27.19\xa0 Whosoever carries out the Commercialization of a Qualifying Invention shall provide the other party or parties, as the case may be, with detailed quarterly progress reports including, where applicable, interim financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, where they differ, the definitions agreed to in this Article.

\n
\xa0
\n
27.23\xa0 In the case where an Invention has more than one Inventor (Co- Inventors), the decision to file a Declaration of Invention and permit the Employer to Commercialize shall be by agreement of the Co- Inventors.

\n
\xa0
\n

\n
\xa0
\n
iv) The difference between the total salary calculated in Article 39.10 d) i) and the sum of the grid salary determined in Article 39.10 d) ii) and the depreciated market supplement calculated in Article 39.10 d) iii) shall become an individual supplement in accordance with the provisions of Article 39.01 c);
\n
\xa0
\n
v) The member shall be informed in writing and by e-mail by the Provost of the result of the steps performed in Article 39.10 d) i) through 39.10 d) iv); if the member wishes to accept the proposed increase, she or he shall so indicate in writing to the Provost, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Provost\u2019s letter.

\n
45.02\xa0 Members may be laid-off in accordance with this Article if a state of financial emergency has been declared and confirmed pursuant to the procedures contained in this Article.
\n
Any such layoff shall not be treated, described or recorded as a suspension or as a dismissal for cause or other disciplinary measure.
\n
45.03\xa0 In the event that the Board of Governors considers that a financial emergency exists, within the meaning of 45.01 and 45.08, it shall give notice of such belief.\xad As of the date of such notice the procedures specified in this Article shall apply, and no new appointments, (excluding the renewal of probationary contracts) may be made to either the academic or administrative staff.\xad No exceptional awards or other discretionary salary increases shall be made and no sabbatical leaves shall be granted.

\n
45.08\xa0 The Financial Commission shall invite and consider submissions on the University\u2019s financial condition. Inter alia, it shall determine:
\n
a)\xa0 whether the University\u2019s financial position (as evidenced from the total budget and not just the academic or salary components thereof) constitutes a bona fide budgetary crisis such that deficits projected by generally accepted accounting principles are expected to continue for more than three (3) consecutive financial years;
\n
b)\xa0 whether in view of the primacy of academic goals at the University, the reduction of the bargaining unit is a reasonable type of cost saving;
\n

\n
d)\xa0 whether all reasonable means of improving the University\u2019s revenue position (including borrowing, deficit financing, and the disposal of assets not essential to the academic function) have been explored and exhausted;

An Extraordinary Academic Committee shall then be established.
\n
The Extraordinary Academic Committee (EAC) shall be composed of two (2) persons appointed by the Board, two (2) persons elected by members of the Association, and a chair from outside the Concordia University community, jointly selected by the four (4) persons identified above.

\n
45.14
\n

c)\xa0 Within each Faculty the Dean shall convene a committee of all academic unit heads. In the case of the Library, the Dean shall convene a committee of Area Heads, Department Heads and Unit Heads.
