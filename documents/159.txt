Office Manager
As a graduate of Concordia University, I was pleased to return in 1994 as the Association\u2019s Office Manager. I am very happy to be here at CUPFA as part of the CUPFA family. I am responsible for the front-line services offered to all members who call and to assist part-time faculty maneuver through the sometimes murky waters of Concordia. If I don\u2019t have the answer to your question, I can certainly steer you in the right direction.

Assistant Grievance Officer
I have been working as Assistant Grievance Officer for CUPFA since 2007, when the position was established. In this regard, I prepare and research issues concerning grievances and the CUPFA Collective Agreement. Working in concert with our Vice President, Collective Agreement and Grievances, I attend when required Grievance Hearings. In addition, I have served numerous terms as the PT Hiring rep for the Departments of Music and Communication Studies from 2002 to the present, as well as on the Music Curriculum Committee. As a member of the CUPFA Advisory Council I sit on the 
Fine Arts Environmental Health and Safety Committee
