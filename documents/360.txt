FAQs about adding location to your Tweets
\n        
\n\n\n        
\n          
\n        \n
Below are some answers to common questions regarding Tweeting with your location. If you're wondering how to Tweet with your location, please see our 
Adding your location to a Tweet
 article.
\n
What location information is attached to my Tweets?
\n
\n
Enabling location services allows you to selectively add location information to your Tweets. 
This feature is off by default and you will need to opt in to use it
.
\n
Once you've 
enabled location services
, you will be able to attach a location (such as a city or neighborhood) of your choice to your Tweet. Simply tap the location marker while composing your Tweet, and select the location you wish to tag.\xa0
(
Note:
\xa0Once you Tweet with a location, your next Tweet will automatically include a general location label. Learn how to turn location off at any time\xa0
here
.)
\n
If you choose to toggle on the "Share precise location" button (available on Twitter for iOS version 6.26 or later, and on Twitter for Android version 5.55 or later), your precise location (latitude and longitude) will be associated with your Tweet and findable via API.\xa0
\n
If you Tweet using an earlier version of Twitter for iOS or Twitter or Android, every Tweet you geotag will include your device's precise location (latitude and longitude) which can be found via API.\xa0
\n
Third-party applications or websites may let you Tweet with location, including your precise location. We ask these developers to clearly explain what information is being shared when you use their products to Tweet with location.\xa0
\n
\n
What controls do I have when I attach location information to my Tweets?
\n
Even after you enable Tweeting with your location, you have additional control over which Tweets (and what type of location information) is shared. With this in mind:
\n
\n
Tweet location is 
off by default
, and as a user you need to 
opt in
 to the service.
\n
You can turn Tweet location on or off at any time.\xa0
\n
You can 
delete your past location data from displaying in your Tweets
 in a single place (see this 
article
 for step-by-step instructions).
\n
Be cautious and careful about the amount of information you share online. There may be some updates where you want to share your location ("The parade is starting now" or "A truck just spilled delicious candy all over the roadway!"), and some updates where you want to keep your location private. 
Just like you might not want to Tweet your home address, please be cautious when Tweeting from locations that you don't want others to see.
\n
\n
Remember that when you're opted into Tweet location, suggested locations may be offered to you, but you can still choose 
not
 to share your location for individual Tweets (see this 
article
 for instructions).
\n
Please familiarize yourself with our general location settings and the settings of any applications and devices you Tweet with so that you are always aware of the information you share.
\n
Remember, once you post something online, it\u2019s out there for others to see.
\n
\n
What location information is displayed?
\n
\n
All geolocation information begins as a location (latitude and longitude), sent from your browser or device. Twitter won't show any location information unless you've 
opted in
 to the feature, and have allowed your device or browser to transmit your coordinates to us.
\n
If you have chosen to attach location information to your Tweets, your selected location label is displayed underneath the text of the Tweet.
\n
On twitter.com, you can select a location label such as the name of a neighborhood or city.
\n
If you tap the location marker while composing your Tweet and toggle on the option to tag your precise location, that Tweet will include both the location label of your choice and your device's precise location (latitude and longitude), which can be found via API. Your precise location may be more specific than the location label you select. 
Note:
 the option to share your precise location is currently available only on newer versions of Twitter for iOS (6.26 or later) and on newer versions of Twitter for Android (version 5.55 or later).\xa0
\n
If you Tweet using an earlier version of Twitter for iOS or Twitter for Android, each Tweet you geotag will include both a location label (this will display alongside your Tweet) and your device's precise location (findable via API).\xa0
\n
Application developers are required to be up-front and obvious about whether your exact coordinates, or just the place, will be included in your Tweet. When you Tweet from a third-party application or mobile device, it should be clear which type of data will be included in your Tweet.\xa0
\n
\n
Having trouble?
\n
Our 
Account Settings troubleshooting section
 has answers to common issues.
\n
Note: In some areas, y
ou have the option to label your Tweet with a specific business, landmark, or point of interest. These places are sourced from Foursquare. If you see an issue with a place, please report it via 
Foursquare\u2019s Help Center
. If you believe that a specific Tweet is abusive, please report it to Twitter by following the instructions 
here
.
