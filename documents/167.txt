Travel and Expenses
University Policy for Travel and Other Allowable Expenses
Two copies of a \u201cGrant Acceptance form\u201d will be enclosed with a letter informing you that you have been awarded a PD grant. Please read this form carefully and keep a copy on-hand for future reference. Don\u2019t forget to sign one copy and return it to CUPFA within 30 days of receiving your grant notification.
All of your expenses must be in accordance with University policy in order to be eligible for reimbursement. If this policy is not followed Financial Services will not reimburse you. Please read the Policy for Travel and other Allowable Expenses carefully \xa0
Policy for travel and other allowable expenses
Paying Professionals
\nNEVER pay someone directly; they must be paid through the University. If hiring an individual or an organization (e.g., technicians, musicians, studio rental), you must complete a cheque requisition form and the University will pay the individual/organization. If you make payment yourself you will not be reimbursed. Contact your budget officer to receive cheque requisition forms.
Paying Concordia Students 
 If you received a PD Grant and are hiring Concordia students you must fill out a RA contract and the student(s) must fill out a TRAC Union membership form. They will still be paid directly from the CUPFA PDA account. Contact your Budget Officer for more information.
 
 Steps for paying a Concordia Student
 
 Make sure you read the TRAC Contract Instructions carefully
 
 1) The Concordia student must fill out a\xa0TRAC membership form
 2) Fill out the contract, sign it\xa0and have the Concordia student/Research Assistant sign it
 3) Return the form to your budget office along with a void cheque for Payroll (so the money can be deposited directly into the student\u2019s account.)
 4) Your budget officer inputs the\xa0CUPFA\xa0budget codes
 5) The completed contract and void cheque will be forwarded to payroll
 6) The TRAC membership form must be forwarded to TRAC

TRAVEL EXPENSES
If you have paid for your airline ticket yourself make sure you save your BOARDING PASSES and submit them with your receipt and expense report. Otherwise the University may not reimburse you.
Concordia University Travel Voucher
\nMembers should consider taking advantage of University travel vouchers to pay for an airline ticket in advance. \xa0Before you book your trip, contact your Budget Officer and they will give you an account code that you must provide when you book your ticket with one of Concordia University\u2019s officially recognized travel agencies. \xa0A completed travel voucher must then be sent to your Budget Officer within 24 hours \xa0of booking the trip. \xa0The name of your Budget Officer appears at the bottom of the contract you signed upon acceptance of your grant. \xa0If you cannot find this important document, please call CUPFA and Karen or Manon will provide the information for you.
