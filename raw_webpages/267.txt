academic excellence in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge, to be achieved principally through teaching, research and community service, and to maintain a strong tradition of both full-time and part-time higher education and to preserve a high standard of education. All other functions at Concordia University exist to support this central academic purpose.</p>\n<p>The parties agree to cooperate in the promotion of teaching and research and to encourage a climate of freedom of speech and enquiry, responsibility and mutual respect in the pursuit of these goals. A university environment characterized by freedom of speech and enquiry is required for the faculty members and librarians to fulfill their responsibilities. Freedom of speech guarantees the open exchange of ideas; freedom of enquiry guarantees the open investigation and interpretation of ideas.</p>\n<p>Within the unique university context, the most crucial right is academic freedom.

The discovery of patentable Inventions is not a basic purpose of University research, nor is it a condition for support of such research. The Employer agrees that members have no obligation to seek patent protection for the results of academic work or to modify research to enhance patentability. The Employer further agrees that members have the unqualified right to decide whether or not to Commercialize their Inventions, subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Article.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.10\xa0 The Employer has the authority to sign, and negotiate when required, any agreement relating to all grants, contracts and other agreements involving funds, sponsorship, research support of any description, whether monetary or in kind.\xa0 With respect to the negotiation and acceptance of terms and conditions in any grant or contract, whether from public or private sources, the Employer shall ensure that the principles of Academic Freedom as defined in this Collective Agreement are respected.\xa0 Any Intellectual Property rights resulting from a Work financed by a grant or contract shall then be governed by the conditions of that grant or contract.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.11\xa0 A member who has produced an Invention which he or she intends to patent and/or Commercialize shall complete a Declaration of Invention (Appendix 9) in which the member states whether the Invention is Independent or Qualifying.

Where there is disagreement on the characterization of the Invention, the matter shall be referred to the PACO in accordance with Articles 27.03 to 27.08. Any challenge by the Employer shall be null and void unless received within the above-noted time limit. Failure to respond to the member within twenty-two (22) days shall be considered as an acceptance of the Invention status declared by the member.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.13\xa0 The Employer has no interest in or claim to any Independent Invention.\xa0 Such Inventions and any patents arising therefrom shall be the sole property of the Inventor. However, a member and the Employer may enter into an agreement to Commercialize an Independent Invention. The Employer and the member shall then enter into an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10A to provide for the terms and conditions of any possible future Commercialization of the Invention.\xa0 The sharing of Net Proceeds will be consistent with the division set out in this Article 27.18 (a).\xa0 A copy of this Appendix shall be sent to the Association at the time of the signature, but information that compromises the protection of the Intellectual Property shall be deleted.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.14</p>\n<p>1)\xa0 A member who decides to patent or patent and Commercialize a Qualifying Invention may proceed as follows:</p>\n<p>a) Patent and Commercialize with the assistance of the Employer and the Employer\u2019s agent; or</p>\n<p>b) Patent and Commercialize without the assistance of the Employer; or</p>\n<p>c) Patent without immediately Commercializing.</p>\n<p>2)\xa0\xa0 The member must select one of the foregoing three options no later than the expiry of the twenty-two (22) days set out in Article 27.15 (a) or 27.16 (a), as the case may be. Where, at the end of this twenty-two (22) day period, the member has made no selection, she or he shall be deemed to have chosen the option set out in Article 27.14 1)(a) and shall sign an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10A.</p>\n<p>27.15 If the member wishes to patent and commercialize a Qualifying Invention with the assistance of the Employer:<strong>\xa0</strong></p>\n<p>a)\xa0 She or he shall so notify the Employer within twenty-two (22) days of the determination that it is a Qualifying Invention, with a copy to the Association.</p>\n<p>b)\xa0 The Employer and the member shall then enter into an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10A to provide for the terms and conditions of any potential protection and Commercialization of the Invention and include the division of Net Proceeds in accordance with Article 27.18(a).\xa0 A copy of this agreement shall be sent to the Association, but information that compromises the protection of the Intellectual Property shall be omitted.</p>\n<p>c)\xa0 Within ninety (90) days of the signing of the agreement set out in Appendix 10A, the Employer shall indicate to the member whether it intends to patent and Commercialize the Invention or not, with a copy to the Association.</p>\n<p>d)\xa0 Where the Employer indicates that the evaluation of the Invention will require more than ninety (90) days, the Employer shall promptly inform the member in writing of this fact, indicating the reasons therefore and indicate what additional time will be required to complete the task of evaluation, with a copy to the Association.\xa0 The additional time shall not exceed sixty (60) days.</p>\n<p>e)\xa0 In the event the Employer chooses not to patent and commercialize the Invention or fails to make this indication to the member within the allotted time, the member is free to patent and commercialize the Invention as she or he sees fit. In such event, except as provided for in Article 27.22, the Employer shall make no further use of the confidential information relating to the Invention. Any Net Proceeds shall be divided as set out in Article 27.18 (b).</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.16\xa0 If the member wishes to patent and Commercialize a Qualifying Invention without the assistance of the Employer, or where the member wishes only to patent the Invention:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>a)\xa0 She or he shall so notify the Employer within twenty two (22) days of the determination that it is a Qualifying Invention, with a copy to the Association.</p>\n<p>b)\xa0 Where the intention is to Commercialize without the assistance of the Employer, he or she shall, enter into an agreement with the Employer in the form set out in Appendix 10B.\xa0 This agreement shall provide that the Commercialization plan and the identity of any third-party investor shall be subject to the approval and consent of the Employer.\xa0 The Employer shall not withhold its consent unreasonably.\xa0 The sharing of Net Proceeds will be consistent with the division set out in Article 27.18 (a). A copy of this agreement shall be sent to the Association, but information that compromises the protection of the Intellectual Property shall be omitted.</p>\n<p>c)\xa0 Where the intention is only to patent the Invention, the Employer and the member shall enter into an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10B, subject to the condition that no Commercialization shall occur, except and until the Inventor gives her or his consent or until the Inventor undertakes any step towards Commercialization.\xa0 Subject to the foregoing agreement, the Employer shall have no further immediate commercial interest, unless the member subsequently does any act or undertakes any step to Commercialize the Invention, whereupon the provisions of the agreement in form 10B shall thereupon take full effect as though the member had originally chosen to Commercialize immediately under 27.14 1)(b).\xa0 The member shall notify the Office of Research in writing of the change in intention.\xa0 The member may, in such notification alter her or his option and select Employer-led Commercialization as set out in 27.14 1)(a) and the provisions of Article 27.15 shall then apply.\xa0 Where the member alters her or his selection and seeks Employer-led Commercialization, the Office of Research may, in its discretion, acting reasonably, evaluate the commercial potential of the Invention before agreeing to Commercialize.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.17\xa0 The Employer, the Association, the member and any other third parties involved in any Commercialization process shall sign confidentiality agreements.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.18\xa0 The division of Net Proceeds shall be made as follows:</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>a)\xa0 Fifty percent (50%) to the member(s), fifty percent (50%) to the Employer;</p>\n<p>b)\xa0 Notwithstanding Article 27.18 (a) above, where the Employer refuses at the outset, as per Article 27.15 (e), to commercialize a Qualifying Invention, the division of Net Proceeds shall be ninety-five percent (95%) to the member(s), five percent (5%) to the Employer.</p>\n<p>27.19\xa0 Whosoever carries out the Commercialization of a Qualifying Invention shall provide the other party or parties, as the case may be, with detailed quarterly progress reports including, where applicable, interim financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, where they differ, the definitions agreed to in this Article.

On ten (10) days\u2019 written notice, either the member or the Employer may examine the books relating to the Qualifying Invention, and whosoever is responsible for maintaining the books shall grant reasonable access to all relevant documentation.This provision applies equally in the case of an Independent Invention where Commercialization is led by the Employer.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.20\xa0 An explicit reference to the dispute resolution procedures of this Article shall be deemed to be included in every Commercialization agreement made with the member, whether for an Independent Invention or a Qualifying Invention.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.21\xa0 The Commercialization of a Qualifying Invention shall not affect the right of the member or members to use the Invention for further research, publication or teaching purposes. This right may be suspended only for the duration of the process necessary to protect the Intellectual Property. The duration of such a process shall not exceed ninety (90) days, unless agreed otherwise by all parties involved, during which a confidentiality agreement shall be in force. This provision applies equally in the case of an Independent Invention where Commercialization is led by the Employer.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.22\xa0 The member shall be deemed to have granted to the Employer a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, indivisible and non-transferable license to use a Qualifying Invention for its own educational, teaching and research purposes for a period of ten years. This right may be suspended only for the duration of the process necessary to protect the Intellectual Property.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>27.23\xa0 In the case where an Invention has more than one Inventor (Co- Inventors), the decision to file a Declaration of Invention and permit the Employer to Commercialize shall be by agreement of the Co- Inventors.

Following each review, the supplement may be maintained, increased, decreased, or eliminated. In the case of a member at the rank of Senior Lecturer, Professor or Senior Librarian, the individual supplement, when maintained in whole or in part, shall be integrated into the member\u2019s grid salary up to the maximum of the salary grid for the member\u2019s rank. Any residual amount shall become a revised individual supplement, subject to review in the fifth year. Individual supplements are not subject to any percentage increases. If a member\u2019s individual supplement is to be decreased or eliminated, the nominal salary remains constant. The member continues to receive the constant nominal salary until such time as the other components of the nominal salary reach the same level as the constant nominal salary.</p>\n<p>c) In all cases, the Provost shall send a reasoned decision to the member with a copy to the Association.</p>\n<p>d) When a member whose salary is governed by the provisions of the Old Model applies for, is granted and elects to receive a salary adjustment, the member\u2019s salary shall be moved to the New Model as follows:</p>\n<p>i) The amount of the salary adjustment shall be added to the member\u2019s current salary;</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>ii) The member\u2019s appropriate placement on the applicable salary grid for the effective year of the increase shall be determined;</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>iii) If applicable, the hypothetical market supplement appropriate to the discipline, taking into consideration the market supplement stated in Appendix 3 and applicable depreciation up to May 31, 2015, according to years since promotion to the rank of Associate Professor, shall be added to the grid salary, using a FAP of $50,000.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>iv) The difference between the total salary calculated in Article 39.10 d) i) and the sum of the grid salary determined in Article 39.10 d) ii) and the depreciated market supplement calculated in Article 39.10 d) iii) shall become an individual supplement in accordance with the provisions of Article 39.01 c);</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>v) The member shall be informed in writing and by e-mail by the Provost of the result of the steps performed in Article 39.10 d) i) through 39.10 d) iv); if the member wishes to accept the proposed increase, she or he shall so indicate in writing to the Provost, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Provost\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p>\xa0</p>\n<p>vi) The amount to be taken into consideration under the provisions of Article 40.04 shall be the amount of the salary adjustment specified in Article 39.01
