the goals of the University are to attain the highest possible standards of academic excellence in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge, to be achieved principally through teaching, research and community service, and to maintain a strong tradition of both full-time and part-time higher education and to preserve a high standard of education. All other functions at Concordia University exist to support this central academic purpose.<p></p>\n<p>The parties agree to cooperate in the promotion of teaching and research and to encourage a climate of freedom of speech and enquiry, responsibility and mutual respect in the pursuit of these goals. A university environment characterized by freedom of speech and enquiry is required for the faculty members and librarians to fulfill their responsibilities. Freedom of speech guarantees the open exchange of ideas; freedom of enquiry guarantees the open investigation and interpretation of ideas.</p>\n<p>Within the unique university context, the most crucial right is academic freedom.

In addition, each Dean, after appropriate consultation, may adapt these criteria in a manner appropriate and reasonable to the particular academic area. In particular, each Dean, after consultation, shall specify whether supervision of student research is to be considered as teaching or research. In all such cases the Dean shall inform all faculty members in writing within a reasonable period of time, before such specification takes effect.</li>\n<li>The evaluation of full-time faculty shall be based upon the consideration of professional competence and potential for fulfilling academic responsibilities as defined in Article 16.</li>\n<li>The evaluation of teaching shall be done by the faculty member\u2019s colleagues on the basis of all evidence of teaching effectiveness presented by the faculty member in a teaching dossier.</li>\n<li>The teaching dossier shall include the following:\n<ol>\n<li>a list of undergraduate and graduate courses, including directed studies taught by the member and, if specified by the Dean as teaching under the provisions of Article 14.01 a), thesis and other student research supervisions undertaken by the member;</li>\n<li>examples of course outlines, assignments, final examinations or other materials the member deems appropriate;</li>\n<li>all aggregate statistical information generated from teaching evaluation questionnaires specified in Article 14.01 f) for each course taught during the period under evaluation.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The teaching dossier may also include, but is not restricted to, the following:\n<ol>\n<li>a record of the member\u2019s role in curriculum innovation and instructional development such as administrative and committee service for the academic unit, Faculty, or Senate related to pedagogy, and including directing and coordinating programs, guest lectures, and other presentations;</li>\n<li>a record of the member\u2019s special contribution to teaching including teaching awards, publications and presentations, instructional development grants, participation in conferences and seminars on education/pedagogy, and other such evidence as the member deems appropriate;</li>\n<li>signed letters and testimonials from students;</li>\n<li>a statement of the member\u2019s objectives and methods of teaching, including reference to institutional and academic unit teaching goals.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A teaching evaluation questionnaire approved by the relevant Faculty Council shall be administered in all courses. The Provost and the President of CUFA shall agree on four questions common to all student evaluation questionnaires.</li>\n<li>Before the adoption of on-line course evaluations in a Faculty, the Dean shall consult Faculty Council.</li>\n<li>The Employer shall endeavour to ensure that anonymity and confidentiality are maintained in the administration of course evaluations.</li>\n<li>The evaluation of research shall depend primarily on the judgment of the faculty member\u2019s disciplinary peers, and shall be made on the basis of evidence of scholarship such as publications, presentations of papers, exhibitions, performances, patents, copyrights, external recognition, grants, contracts and other awards and, if appropriate (see Article 14.01 a)), thesis and other student research supervision undertaken by the member, as presented by the faculty member in a research dossier.

When the Employer prepares the digital dossier, the member shall ensure that she or he is satisfied with its contents.</li>\n<li>The academic unit head shall ensure that the dossier contains:\n<ol>\n<li>In the case of probationary members, reports produced in the course of the most recent reappointment exercise;</li>\n<li>In the case of tenured and ETA members with a five (5) year contract, reports produced in the course of the most recent performance evaluation.</li>\n<li>In the context of this clause, \u201creports\u201d shall mean reasoned reports, recommendations and decisions issued by the DPC, FPTC, Dean, and Provost, as applicable.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The academic unit head and the Dean may supplement the dossier submitted by the candidate with relevant information at the start of the DPC stage of the proceedings. In this instance, the candidate shall be informed of the nature of this information, shall receive copies of all supplemental documentation and shall have five (5) days to provide any commentary relevant to this supplementary information. If the candidate subsequently sends additional information to the FPTC, a copy shall be sent to the DPC.</li>\n<li>The evaluation of members holding a joint or cross appointment shall be conducted by the primary unit, which shall seek input from the secondary unit or units.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>EVALUATION OF PROBATIONARY AND NOMINALLY TENURED FACULTY MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REAPPOINTMENT\n<ol>\n<li>Reappointments for probationary members shall be for a period of two (2) years terminating on May 31.

The faculty member shall be so informed prior to appointment.</li>\n<li>In the case of a reappointment of a nominally tenured member, she or he is expected to address the status of his or her application for Permanent Residency only.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>PROMOTION OF PROBATIONARY FACULTY MEMBERS FROM LECTURER TO ASSISTANT PROFESSOR<br/>\nA probationary faculty member appointed at the rank of Lecturer shall be automatically promoted to the rank of Assistant Professor following completion of all requirements for the terminal degree and placed on the salary grid in accordance with the following provisions:<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The date of promotion from Lecturer to Assistant Professor shall be retroactive to the start date of the contract provided that the date of completion of all requirements of the terminal degree occurs within six (6) months of that date; otherwise, the promotion shall occur on the date of completion of all requirements of the terminal degree.</li>\n<li>Promotion shall be granted on the basis of a letter from the university that awarded the terminal degree formally attesting to the date of completion of all requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>PROMOTION FROM ASSISTANT PROFESSOR TO ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR<br/>\nUpon the granting of tenure, faculty members who hold the rank of Assistant Professor shall be promoted to the rank of Associate Professor.</li>\n<li>PROMOTION FROM ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR TO PROFESSOR\n<ol>\n<li>The following criteria for promotion to the rank of Professor, while laying down the broad qualifications for the rank, are at the same time intended to provide sufficient flexibility to enable each academic unit to apply the standards it considers relevant to its field. While the career paths of individuals will vary, it is expected that the majority of tenured faculty members will meet the qualifications for this rank, albeit at different points, in their careers.</li>\n<li>The rank of Professor may be attained by fulfilling any one of the following sets of criteria:</li>\n<li>Research/scholarly achievement/creative professional work that is demonstrably superior over a sustained period of time, together with university teaching that has been demonstrated over the years to be of good quality.\n<ol>\n<li>The candidate shall submit a research dossier to demonstrate that she or he has made a substantial contribution to her or his field through research, scholarly achievement or creative professional work. While the greatest weight will be given to research/scholarly achievement or creative/professional work, the candidate shall also submit a teaching dossier to demonstrate that her or his teaching has been of good quality.</li>\n<li>In this category, a faculty member may be considered following completion of six (6) years of service at the rank of Associate Professor.</li>\n<li>In exceptional cases, a member may be considered for promotion before the completion of six (6) years of service, with the proviso that promotion shall be granted only on the basis of a record of achievement consistent with that normally required for promotion.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Teaching that is demonstrably superior over a sustained period of time together with scholarship/creative professional work which has been demonstrated over the years to be of good quality.\n<ol>\n<li>The candidate shall submit a teaching dossier to demonstrate that she or he has made a substantial contribution to higher education through teaching and other pedagogical activities. While the greatest weight will be given to the quality of teaching, the candidate shall also submit a research dossier to demonstrate that her or his scholarly activity or creative professional work has been of good quality.</li>\n<li>In this category, a faculty member may be considered for promotion following completion of six (6) years of service at the rank of Associate Professor.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A combination of teaching; scholarship/creative professional work; and service to the academic and professional community that has been demonstrated over the individual\u2019s career to be of good quality.\n<ol>\n<li>The candidate shall demonstrate, by means of the complete dossier, that she or he has maintained a career profile that combines dedicated teaching, an ongoing engagement in scholarly work and service contributions to the University and the professional and academic community. It is understood that the greatest weight will be given to the candidate\u2019s aggregate contributions to the University over a sustained period of time, rather than to any one of the three areas of responsibility. It is also understood that teaching, research, and service might evolve and assume different proportions at various periods in a member\u2019s academic life.</li>\n<li>In this category a faculty member may be considered for promotion following the completion of nineteen (19) years in the combined ranks of Assistant and Associate Professor.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NOTE: The provisions of Article 14.05 e) shall apply until May 31, 2014, at which time they shall become null and void.

The Employer assumes no responsibility for the taxation status of such a grant and shall report such grants in accordance with the income tax laws and regulations.</li>\n<li>Other remuneration which the member may receive during the period of salaried leave is limited to an amount that brings the total to one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of nominal salary inclusive of any sum identified as research grant under 26.09 above, but exclusive of grants for research purposes, monies obtained for authorized outside professional activities, expenses covered by the Employer and payments by other bodies to defray the travel and related expenses for the member. If other remuneration is sufficient to cause total salary income to exceed one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of nominal salary, the Employer will reduce its salary payment by an amount equal to that excess. Within three (3) months of returning from sabbatical leave, the member shall forward to the Provost a written declaration of the amount of remuneration received.</li>\n<li>The Parties recognize that a member who has been granted a sabbatical leave has an obligation to return to the University on completion of the leave for a period of time at least equivalent to the duration of the leave, except in the case of a faculty member who retires immediately following a sabbatical leave.</li>\n<li>Within three (3) months of returning from sabbatical leave, the member shall prepare and forward to the Dean, with a copy to the Association, a full written account of the member\u2019s research, scholarly and professional activities during the leave.

The Employer and the Association will each name one (1) person to act as advisor to the arbitrator.\n<p>PATENTS</p></li>\n<li>The provisions of this section apply to the property rights and Commercialization of Inventions developed at the University by members. The discovery of patentable Inventions is not a basic purpose of University research, nor is it a condition for support of such research. The Employer agrees that members have no obligation to seek patent protection for the results of academic work or to modify research to enhance patentability. The Employer further agrees that members have the unqualified right to decide whether or not to Commercialize their Inventions, subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Article.</li>\n<li>The Employer has the authority to sign, and negotiate when required, any agreement relating to all grants, contracts and other agreements involving funds, sponsorship, research support of any description, whether monetary or in kind. With respect to the negotiation and acceptance of terms and conditions in any grant or contract, whether from public or private sources, the Employer shall ensure that the principles of Academic Freedom as defined in this Collective Agreement are respected. Any Intellectual Property rights resulting from a Work financed by a grant or contract shall then be governed by the conditions of that grant or contract.</li>\n<li>A member who has produced an Invention which he or she intends to patent and/or Commercialize shall complete a Declaration of Invention (Appendix 9) in which the member states whether the Invention is Independent or Qualifying. The Declaration of Invention shall be filed with the Employer\u2019s Office of Research, which shall forward a copy of Part I to the Association as soon as the Declaration of Invention has been confirmed to be complete by the Office of Research and signed by the Director. If the member fails to disclose the existence of a Qualifying Invention and proceeds with Commercialization, it shall be understood that the Employer maintains its rights under this Article.</li>\n<li>The Employer shall, within twenty-two (22) days of the signing by the Director of the Office of Research of the completed Declaration of Invention, inform the member in writing with a copy to the Association whether it consents to the member\u2019s declaration. Where there is disagreement on the characterization of the Invention, the matter shall be referred to the PACO in accordance with Articles 27.03 to 27.08. Any challenge by the Employer shall be null and void unless received within the above-noted time limit. Failure to respond to the member within twenty-two (22) days shall be considered as an acceptance of the Invention status declared by the member.</li>\n<li>The Employer has no interest in or claim to any Independent Invention. Such Inventions and any patents arising therefrom shall be the sole property of the Inventor. However, a member and the Employer may enter into an agreement to Commercialize an Independent Invention. The Employer and the member shall then enter into an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10A to provide for the terms and conditions of any possible future Commercialization of the Invention. The sharing of Net Proceeds will be consistent with the division set out in this Article 27.18 (a). A copy of this Appendix shall be sent to the Association at the time of the signature, but information that compromises the protection of the Intellectual Property shall be deleted.</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>A member who decides to patent or patent and Commercialize a Qualifying Invention may proceed as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>Patent and Commercialize with the assistance of the Employer and the Employer\u2019s agent; or</li>\n<li>Patent and Commercialize without the assistance of the Employer; or</li>\n<li>Patent without immediately Commercializing.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The member must select one of the foregoing three options no later than the expiry of the twenty-two (22) days set out in Article 27.15 (a) or 27.16 (a), as the case may be. Where, at the end of this twenty-two (22) day period, the member has made no selection, she or he shall be deemed to have chosen the option set out in Article 27.14 1)(a) and shall sign an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10A.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If the member wishes to patent and commercialize a Qualifying Invention with the assistance of the Employer:\n<ol>\n<li>She or he shall so notify the Employer within twenty-two (22) days of the determination that it is a Qualifying Invention, with a copy to the Association.</li>\n<li>The Employer and the member shall then enter into an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10A to provide for the terms and conditions of any potential protection and Commercialization of the Invention and include the division of Net Proceeds in accordance with Article 27.18(a). A copy of this agreement shall be sent to the Association, but information that compromises the protection of the Intellectual Property shall be omitted.</li>\n<li>Within ninety (90) days of the signing of the agreement set out in Appendix 10A, the Employer shall indicate to the member whether it intends to patent and Commercialize the Invention or not, with a copy to the Association.</li>\n<li>Where the Employer indicates that the evaluation of the Invention will require more than ninety (90) days, the Employer shall promptly inform the member in writing of this fact, indicating the reasons therefore and indicate what additional time will be required to complete the task of evaluation, with a copy to the Association. The additional time shall not exceed sixty (60) days.</li>\n<li>In the event the Employer chooses not to patent and commercialize the Invention or fails to make this indication to the member within the allotted time, the member is free to patent and commercialize the Invention as she or he sees fit. In such event, except as provided for in Article 27.22, the Employer shall make no further use of the confidential information relating to the Invention. Any Net Proceeds shall be divided as set out in Article 27.18 (b).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If the member wishes to patent and Commercialize a Qualifying Invention without the assistance of the Employer, or where the member wishes only to patent the Invention:\n<ol>\n<li>She or he shall so notify the Employer within twenty two (22) days of the determination that it is a Qualifying Invention, with a copy to the Association.</li>\n<li>Where the intention is to Commercialize without the assistance of the Employer, he or she shall, enter into an agreement with the Employer in the form set out in Appendix 10B. This agreement shall provide that the Commercialization plan and the identity of any third-party investor shall be subject to the approval and consent of the Employer. The Employer shall not withhold its consent unreasonably. The sharing of Net Proceeds will be consistent with the division set out in Article 27.18 (a). A copy of this agreement shall be sent to the Association, but information that compromises the protection of the Intellectual Property shall be omitted.</li>\n<li>Where the intention is only to patent the Invention, the Employer and the member shall enter into an agreement in the form set out in Appendix 10B, subject to the condition that no Commercialization shall occur, except and until the Inventor gives her or his consent or until the Inventor undertakes any step towards Commercialization. Subject to the foregoing agreement, the Employer shall have no further immediate commercial interest, unless the member subsequently does any act or undertakes any step to Commercialize the Invention, whereupon the provisions of the agreement in form 10B shall thereupon take full effect as though the member had originally chosen to Commercialize immediately under 27.14 1)(b). The member shall notify the Office of Research in writing of the change in intention. The member may, in such notification alter her or his option and select Employer-led Commercialization as set out in 27.14 1)(a) and the provisions of Article 27.15 shall then apply. Where the member alters her or his selection and seeks Employer-led Commercialization, the Office of Research may, in its discretion, acting reasonably, evaluate the commercial potential of the Invention before agreeing to Commercialize.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The Employer, the Association, the member and any other third parties involved in any Commercialization process shall sign confidentiality agreements.</li>\n<li>The division of Net Proceeds shall be made as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>Fifty percent (50%) to the member(s), fifty percent (50%) to the Employer;</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding Article 27.18 (a) above, where the Employer refuses at the outset, as per Article 27.15 (e), to commercialize a Qualifying Invention, the division of Net Proceeds shall be ninety-five percent (95%) to the member(s), five percent (5%) to the Employer.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Whosoever carries out the Commercialization of a Qualifying Invention shall provide the other party or parties, as the case may be, with detailed quarterly progress reports including, where applicable, interim financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, where they differ, the definitions agreed to in this Article. The distribution of Net Proceeds shall be on the basis of the annual financial statements but only when accumulated Net Proceeds are positive. Negative Net Proceeds shall be carried forward as an opening balance to the next period. On ten (10) days\u2019 written notice, either the member or the Employer may examine the books relating to the Qualifying Invention, and whosoever is responsible for maintaining the books shall grant reasonable access to all relevant documentation. This provision applies equally in the case of an Independent Invention where Commercialization is led by the Employer.</li>\n<li>An explicit reference to the dispute resolution procedures of this Article shall be deemed to be included in every Commercialization agreement made with the member, whether for an Independent Invention or a Qualifying Invention.</li>\n<li>The Commercialization of a Qualifying Invention shall not affect the right of the member or members to use the Invention for further research, publication or teaching purposes. This right may be suspended only for the duration of the process necessary to protect the Intellectual Property. The duration of such a process shall not exceed ninety (90) days, unless agreed otherwise by all parties involved, during which a confidentiality agreement shall be in force. This provision applies equally in the case of an Independent Invention where Commercialization is led by the Employer.</li>\n<li>The member shall be deemed to have granted to the Employer a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, indivisible and non-transferable license to use a Qualifying Invention for its own educational, teaching and research purposes for a period of ten years. This right may be suspended only for the duration of the process necessary to protect the Intellectual Property.</li>\n<li>In the case where an Invention has more than one Inventor (Co- Inventors), the decision to file a Declaration of Invention and permit the Employer to Commercialize shall be by agreement of the Co- Inventors. In the event that the Co-Inventors cannot reach an agreement, the question shall be referred to the PACO in accordance with Articles 27.03 to 27.08.</li>\n<li>Where a third party, not a member of the University, is a Co-Inventor of a Qualifying Invention, the member or members shall not consent to any plan of Commercialization that contravenes this Article.</li>\n<li>The Concordia name, or any reference to Concordia, whether explicit or implicit, will not be used in connection with the development of an Invention without the express, prior written consent of the Employer.COPYRIGHT</li>\n<li>Copyright protects the right of expression and the right to publish, reproduce and distribute that expression. More particularly, in relation to a specific Work, Copyright means the sole right to produce or reproduce the Work or any part thereof in any form or in any medium chosen, to perform the Work or any part thereof in public or, if the Work is unpublished, to publish the Work or part thereof.</li>\n<li>Copyright applies to all original Works as that term is understood by the Copyright Act, including but not limited to: scholarly, scientific, literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and recorded works, including Course or Instructional Materials in any material or electronic form.</li>\n<li>The member will retain the Copyright of any Work, including Course or Instructional Materials, which results from research and teaching activities, except Commissioned Works. The Employer has no interest in or claim to any such Work, whether published or not, that the member has prepared, whether in the course of employment or otherwise. In the case of Commissioned Works, Article 27.30 applies.</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Notwithstanding Article 27.28 the member shall be deemed to have granted to the Employer for ten years, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, indivisible, non-transferable license to use any Work for research and teaching purposes of the University, provided that the Author is credited in every use and entitled, at her or his request, to correct, update or replace any Work or any part of any Work.</li>\n<li>The license granted to the Employer under Article 27.29 (a) will not be deemed to have conferred any right upon the Employer to Commercialize or to use the Work in e-Concordia or any private teaching endeavour, including any on-line or distance training or education programme that is not part of the regular teaching activities of Concordia University.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Where the Work is a Commissioned Work from the Employer or the result of a particular contract or grant held by the member through the University, the right to Copyright and the rights to royalties or other income shall be determined by the terms of that commission, grant or contract. In the case of a Work commissioned by the Employer, the Copyright shall remain with the Employer, unless the terms of the commission state that Copyright shall remain with the member.</li>\n<li>The member shall retain all moral rights to any Work at all times. Nothing in this provision shall abridge, or impede the member\u2019s right to control her or his Work and to make decisions regarding it.</li>\n<li>Where the Employer engages in any teaching initiative or programme through a third party or as part of an ancillary correspondence teaching programme, including on-line, other electronic or distance teaching programmes and wishes to include the Work of any member in that teaching initiative or programme, the Employer shall request permission to use the Work from the member. Should the member agree, the use of the Work shall be subject to a written agreement between the member and the Employer. A copy of this agreement shall be sent to the Association at least five (5) days before signing.</li>\n<li>Should the Employer wish to erase or otherwise cease to use any member\u2019s Work, the member shall be given one (1) year\u2019s notice in writing of such intention and shall be permitted during that time to take either the original or a copy of all or a part of the work for her or his own use, and at a cost not exceeding the cost of the medium by which the work has been recorded. If the Employer decides to archive a member\u2019s Work, the member shall always have access to the archival copy.</li>\n<li>In the case of software which falls under the scope of patent protection, any Commercialization of that software or other Work, whether Commissioned or not, shall be subject to the provisions of this Article dealing with patent Commercialization, including the division of Net Proceeds.Concluding Provisions</li>\n<li>Where appropriate, the provisions of this Article shall apply to all Co-Inventors or Authors mutatis mutandis in accordance with the agreed-upon division of Article 27.23.</li>\n<li>The salary and benefits or any part thereof of a member and the provision of standard academic facilities shall not be included as a cost item in the calculation of Specified Costs in this Article.</li>\n<li>In the event that the Employer or assignee relinquishes its rights in any Work, all rights shall revert back to the member. In the event that the member is deceased, the rights shall revert to the estate or succession of the member. At the request of the member or the member\u2019s representative the Employer will promptly execute any transfer or other document necessary to confirm the reversion of rights to the member or the member\u2019s estate or succession, as the case may be.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class="back-to-top" href="#agreement-header">Back to Top</a>\n\t\t\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<article class="agreement-article" id="article-320">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 class="entry-title">RESIGNATION</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ol>\n<li>A member who resigns shall give notice in writing to the appropriate Dean with copies to the Vice-President and the Association.

The faculty member shall give at least three (3) months notice. If the Employer agrees to accept a resignation tendered between March 1 and September 1, it reserves the right to establish May 31 as the effective date of resignation. If, however, a member is to take up a full-time university appointment elsewhere and the member is active at Concordia between June 1 and August 31, employment at Concordia University may, at the discretion of the Dean after consultation with the academic unit head, terminate on the date the member takes up such other appointment. In this context \u201cactive\u201d means conducting research, supervising graduate or undergraduate students or discharging a part of their regular assigned teaching duties (Article 16.04) for the year commencing on June 1.</li>\n<li>Librarian members who are on a leave without pay under Article 32 for a period of eight (8) months or more shall give at least three (3) months notice.

degree.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>TREATMENT OF NEW MODEL SALARY COMPONENTS ON PROMOTION\n<ol>\n<li>Grid Salary<br/>\nThe member\u2019s salary shall be adjusted on promotion as follows:<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The member shall receive a transitional increase of one step on the salary grid for the old rank; in the case of members whose salary is at the maximum for the rank, the transitional increase is equivalent to the value of the highest step for the rank;</li>\n<li>The member shall then be placed on the salary grid for the new rank at the step equivalent to the transitional salary determined above. Should the grid salary fall between steps, it shall be rounded up to the next higher step.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Market Supplement\n<ol>\n<li>If the market supplement for faculty members is equal to or greater than 50% of the Floor of Assistant Professor (FAP) at the time of hire (the initial FAP), it is reduced by 8% of the initial FAP at the time of promotion to Associate Professor and then reduced annually by 1.5% of the initial FAP.</li>\n<li>If the market supplement for faculty members is less than 50% of FAP (43% of the FAP for librarian members), it is reduced by an amount equal to 16% of the initial amount at the time of promotion to Associate Professor or Associate Librarian and then reduced annually by 3.0% of the initial amount.</li>\n<li>If the reduction of the market supplement exceeds the increase in the grid salary in any year, the nominal salary is not reduced. Such members continue to receive their constant nominal salary until such time as the other components of their nominal salary reach the same level as the constant nominal salary.</li>\n<li>Reductions in the market supplement cease when the depreciated market supplement reaches zero.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Individual Supplement<br/>\nUpon promotion to the rank of Associate Professor, Professor, Associate Librarian, Senior Librarian, or Senior Lecturer, the salary of regular members with individual supplements shall be adjusted as follows:<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The amount of the individual supplement shall be added to the member\u2019s grid salary for the new rank on the effective date of the promotion.</li>\n<li>The resulting salary shall be compared with the applicable grid for the new rank on the effective date of the promotion.</li>\n<li>Should the resulting salary correspond exactly to a step on the grid, the member shall be placed at that step.</li>\n<li>Should the resulting salary fall between steps, it shall be rounded up to the next higher step.</li>\n<li>Should the resulting salary exceed the maximum grid salary for the new rank, the member\u2019s salary shall be placed at the highest step on the grid. In such case, the residual amount shall be treated as an Individual Supplement, keeping the original expiry date.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>ANNUAL REVISION OF NEW MODEL SALARY COMPONENTS\n<ol>\n<li>Grid Salary<br/>\nThe salary grid shall be adjusted each June 1 in accordance with the provisions of Article 40.Members below the ceiling of their rank move up a step on the grid each year, effective June 1, provided that either performance has been at least satisfactory in the biennial performance review or they are not subject to review as per Article 14.14 or Article 15.11.Members on leave without pay for more than one regular term in the previous academic year shall not receive a step increase. Members in the midst of a leave without pay extending for more than one regular term shall not receive a step increase.</li>\n<li>Market Supplement<br/>\nMarket supplements remain constant during the years as Lecturer, Assistant Professor, or Assistant Librarian. Following promotion to Associate Professor or Associate Librarian, market supplements shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Article 39.04 b).</li>\n<li>Individual Supplement<br/>\nIndividual supplements are unaffected by annual increases.</li>\n<li>Permanent Supplement<br/>\nPermanent supplements are unaffected by annual increases.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>OLD MODEL SALARY COMPONENTS<br/>\nMembers whose salary increases are governed by the Old Model may have up to two different components to their nominal salary. These include a base salary and an equity supplement.<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Base Salary<br/>\nThe base salary is not determined in accordance with a salary grid.</li>\n<li>Equity Supplement<br/>\nEquity supplements granted under the provisions of the Collective Agreement signed on March 3, 2003 remain unchanged as long as the member\u2019s salary is governed by the Old Model.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>ANNUAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT INCREMENTS (CDI) FOR MEMBERS WHOSE SALARY INCREASES ARE GOVERNED BY THE OLD MODEL.<br/>\nMembers whose salary is below the ceiling of the applicable rank as per the salary grid receive a Career Development Increment (CDI) increase equivalent to one percent (1%) of the Floor of Assistant Professor each year, effective June 1, provided that performance has been at least satisfactory in the biennial performance review.Members on leave without pay for more than one regular term in the previous academic year shall not receive a CDI increase. Members in the midst of a leave without pay extending for more than one regular term shall not receive a CDI increase.</li>\n<li>TREATMENT OF OLD MODEL SALARY COMPONENTS ON PROMOTION<br/>\nOn promotion, the sum of the base salary and equity supplement shall be compared to the salary floor for the new rank (as determined by the salary grid). If the salary floor for the new rank is higher than the sum of the base salary and equity supplement, the member\u2019s revised base salary shall be set at the salary floor for the new rank. In such a case, the equity supplement shall be discontinued.The adjustment is applied after the CDI is awarded.</li>\n<li>APPROVAL AND REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLEMENTS\n<ol>\n<li>Subsequent to appointment, on the recommendation of the Dean, and with the approval of the Salary Review Committee (SARC), the Provost may grant a member an individual supplement or increase an individual supplement already granted to respond to external university market conditions.</li>\n<li>An individual supplement remains constant for a five (5) year period and shall be reviewed in the fifth year unless it has been fully integrated into a member\u2019s grid salary. Following each review, the supplement may be maintained, increased, decreased, or eliminated. In the case of a member at the rank of Senior Lecturer, Professor or Senior Librarian, the individual supplement, when maintained in whole or in part, shall be integrated into the member\u2019s grid salary up to the maximum of the salary grid for the member\u2019s rank. Any residual amount shall become a revised individual supplement, subject to review in the fifth year. Individual supplements are not subject to any percentage increases. If a member\u2019s individual supplement is to be decreased or eliminated, the nominal salary remains constant. The member continues to receive the constant nominal salary until such time as the other components of the nominal salary reach the same level as the constant nominal salary.</li>\n<li>In all cases, the Provost shall send a reasoned decision to the member with a copy to the Association.</li>\n<li>When a member whose salary is governed by the provisions of the Old Model applies for, is granted and elects to receive a salary adjustment, the member\u2019s salary shall be moved to the New Model as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>The amount of the salary adjustment shall be added to the member\u2019s current salary;</li>\n<li>The member\u2019s appropriate placement on the applicable salary grid for the effective year of the increase shall be determined;</li>\n<li>If applicable, the hypothetical market supplement appropriate to the discipline, taking into consideration the market supplement stated in Appendix 3 and applicable depreciation according to years since promotion to the rank of Associate Professor, shall be added to the grid salary, using a FAP of $50,000.</li>\n<li>The difference between the total salary calculated in Article 39.10 d) i) and the sum of the grid salary determined in Article 39.10 d) ii) and the depreciated market supplement calculated in Article 39.10 d) iii) shall become an individual supplement in accordance with the provisions of Article 39.01 c);</li>\n<li>The member shall be informed in writing and by e-mail by the Provost of the result of the steps performed in Article 39.10 d) i) through 39.10 d) iv); if the member wishes to accept the proposed increase, she or he shall so indicate in writing to the Provost, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Provost\u2019s letter.</li>\n<li>The amount to be taken into consideration under
